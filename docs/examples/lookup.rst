Basic usage
===========

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 15

  import importlib.resources

  from symspellpy import SymSpell, Verbosity

  sym_spell = SymSpell(max_dictionary_edit_distance=2, prefix_length=7)
  dictionary_path = importlib.resources("symspellpy") / "frequency_dictionary_en_82_765.txt"
  # term_index is the column of the term and count_index is the
  # column of the term frequency
  sym_spell.load_dictionary(dictionary_path, term_index=0, count_index=1)

  # lookup suggestions for single-word input strings
  input_term = "memebers"  # misspelling of "members"
  # max edit distance per lookup
  # (max_edit_distance_lookup <= max_dictionary_edit_distance)
  suggestions = sym_spell.lookup(input_term, Verbosity.CLOSEST, max_edit_distance=2)
  # display suggestion term, edit distance, and term frequency
  for suggestion in suggestions:
      print(suggestion)

Output::

  members, 1, 226656153

Return original word if no correction within edit distance is found

  # lookup suggestions for single-word input strings
  input_term = "apastraphee"  # misspelling of "apostrophe"
  # max edit distance per lookup
  # (max_edit_distance_lookup <= max_dictionary_edit_distance)
  suggestions = sym_spell.lookup(
      input_term, Verbosity.CLOSEST, max_edit_distance=2, include_unknown=True
  )
  # display suggestion term, edit distance, and term frequency
  for suggestion in suggestions:
      print(suggestion)

Output::

  apastraphee, 3, 0

Note that `suggestions` would have been empty if `include_unknown` was
`False`.

Avoid correcting phrases matching regex

  )
  # display suggestion term, edit distance, and term frequency
  for suggestion in suggestions:
      print(suggestion)

Output::

  members1, 0, 1

Note that `members, 1, 226656153` would be returned if `ignore_token` wasn't
specified.

Keep original casing

Output::

Note that the uppercase of the second "E" was not passed on to "b" in the
corrected word.
